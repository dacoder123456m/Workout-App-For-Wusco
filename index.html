        <h3>"You have a duty to fulfill; you have to repay the debt that God and your family gave you to even live with an able body and not die in a car crash at a young age or get hit by a bus at 5. Start to work, start to show God the beauty of his creation, and you will be amazed at how lucky you are." </h1>
        <h3> Do you want to be a failure? Do you want to live life seeing yourself as never having a purpose or obligation, just going through life with zero happiness or direction? Working a dead-end job and hoping you will retire at 60. You don't deserve to be great if you never take action, control your mind, and take back control of your life. You have to look at your friends and see if anyone is disciplined enough and not so attached to the matrix to follow you, work, take back control, and be successful. If none fit this category, say goodbye. You will find friends along the way. <h3>
